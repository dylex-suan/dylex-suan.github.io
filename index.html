                <p>Over the past few years, I've been heavily involved with projects extending beyond Computer Science
                    -- from structural engineering to botany! Below are some of my projects, several of which have gone on
                    to regional and national science fairs such as the Canada Wide Science Fair.</p>

                    <h2>Ameliorating Salinity Tolerance in Broccoli Plants by Acclimation</h2>
                    <p>I investigated phytoremediation properties found in normal broccoli plants that could potentially be
                        used as a potential application for desalination.
                        This project was presented at the Bay Area Science and Engineering Fair (BASEF), which was
                        subsequently awarded a gold medal. At the Canada Wide Science Fair (CWSF) in Regina, Saskatchewan,
                        this was awarded a bronze medal in the Environment Category.

                    <p>I investigated different bridge designs that would help to mitigate aeroelastic flutter of suspension
