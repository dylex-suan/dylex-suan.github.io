    </h1>
    <p>Over the past few years, I've been heavily involved with projects extending beyond Computer Science -- from
        structural engineering to botany! Below are some of my projects, several of which have gone on
        to regional and national science fairs such as the Canada Wide Science Fair.</p>
    <!-- Note: place image here for the CwSF 2017 in REGINA-->
    <h2>Ameliorating Salinity Tolerance in Broccoli Plants by Acclmiation</h2>
    <img>
    <p>I investigated phytoremediation properties found in normal broccoli plants that could potentially be used as a
        potential application for desalination.
        This project was presented at the Bay Area Science and Engineering Fair (BASEF), which was subsequently awarded
        a gold medal. At the Canada Wide Science Fair (CWSF) in Regina, Saskatchewan,
        this was awarded a bronze medal in the Environment Category.
    </p>
    <h2>An Investigation on Aeroelastic Flutter Reduction of Suspension Bridges</h2>
    <!--Note: place image here for CWSF 2016 in Montreal, there are some online-->
    <img>
    <p>I investigated different designs that would help to mitigate aeroelastic flutter of suspension bridges. This
        project was presented at the Bay Area Science and Engineering Fair (BASEF)
        which subsequently earned a gold medal. I went to the Canada Wide Science Fair in Montreal to compete against
        over 500 students across Canada.
